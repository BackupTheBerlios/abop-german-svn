		Python is probably one of the few programming languages which is both
		simple and powerful. This is good for both and beginners as well as
		experts, and more importantly, is fun to program with. This book aims
		to help you learn this wonderful language and show how to get things
		done quickly and painlessly - in effect 'The Perfect Anti-venom to your
		programming problems'.

		<title>Who This Book Is For</title>
		<para>
			This book serves as a guide or tutorial to the Python programming
			language. It is mainly targeted at newbies. It is useful for experienced
			programmers as well.
		</para>
		<para>
			The aim is that if all you know about computers is how to save text files,
			then you can learn Python from this book. If you have previous programming
			experience, then you can also learn Python from this book.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you do have previous programming experience, you will be interested in
			the differences between Python and your favorite programming language - I
			have highlighted many such differences. A little warning though, Python is
			soon going to become your favorite programming language!

		<title>History Lesson</title>
		
		<para>
			I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for my
			software <ulink url="http://www.g2swaroop.net/software/">Diamond</ulink>
			so that I could make the installation easy. I had to choose between
			Python and Perl bindings for the Qt library. I did some research on the web
			and I came across an article where Eric S. Raymond, the famous and respected
			hacker, talked about how Python has become his favorite programming language.
			I also found out that the PyQt bindings were very good compared to Perl-Qt.
			So, I decided that Python was the language for me.
		</para>
		<para>
			Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find any!
			I did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too expensive or were more
			like a reference manual than a guide. So, I settled for the documentation that
			came with Python. However, it was too brief and small. It did give a good idea
			about Python but was not complete. I managed with it since I had previous
			programming experience, but it was unsuitable for newbies.
		</para>
		<para>
			About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the (then) latest
			Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. I got excited about it and
			suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff on Python. I started writing a few
			pages but it quickly became 30 pages long. Then, I became serious about making it
			more useful in a book form. After a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of rewrites, it has
			reached a stage where it has become a useful guide to learning the Python language.
			I consider this book to be my contribution and tribute to the open source community.
		</para>
		<para>
			This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still consider it in the
			same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to make it more palatable to others :)
		</para>
		<para>
			In the true spirit of open source, I have received lots of constructive suggestions,
			criticisms and <link linkend="feedback">feedback</link> from enthusiastic readers
			which has helped me improve this book a lot.

		<title>Status of the book</title>
		
		<para>
			This book is a <emphasis role="bold">work-in-progress</emphasis>. Many chapters
			are constantly being changed and improved. However, the book has matured a lot.
			You should be able to learn Python easily from this book. Please do tell me if
			you find any part of the book to be incorrect or incomprehensible.
		</para>
		<para>
			More chapters are planned for the future, such as on wxPython, Twisted and maybe
			even Boa Constructor.
